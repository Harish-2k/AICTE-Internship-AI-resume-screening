This project presents an AI-powered resume screening and candidate ranking system designed to streamline the recruitment process by automating the evaluation of resumes. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning, the system extracts key information from resumes and ranks candidates based on their relevance to a given job description. The implementation, built with Python and Streamlit, leverages TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to assess the suitability of candidates efficiently. Initial results indicate a significant reduction in manual screening time and an improvement in accuracy. Future enhancements could include sentiment analysis and soft skills evaluation
